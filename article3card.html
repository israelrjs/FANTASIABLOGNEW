                        Have you felt incomplete lately? Have you been wanting to receive a sense of excitement, or an
                        adrenaline rush? What about having the satisfaction of saying you have done something? I know
                        exactly how you feel. I remember thinking that my life was boring, and that I didn’t have
                        anything to live forward to. That. Is. A. Lie. Never assume that your life is over and that you
                        can’t do it. You can. It only takes your mind to process and understand that. You need to train
                        it.

                        My bucket list has been growing extremely long for the last few years, and I have slowly been
                        checking them off of my list. Now, I have bigger and better ideas that I wanted to share with
                        you, and maybe we could do them together! Some of these categories in the list will be
                        dangerous, so be aware. Remember, don’t do any of these things at home without the supervision
                        of a professional of some sort.

                    <img src="Bucketlistimg/Picture2.png" style="height: 70%; margin-left: 15%;" />

                        I believe in Self-Fulfilling Prophecies. If you write it down, you will most likely accomplish
                        it. According to Psychologist Gael Wood, If You Don’t Write Your Goals Down, You Might Not
                        Achieve Them. Being that I study psychology, I believe in this particular theory because it has
                        worked for me. When I write my goals down, I have the sense of responsibility to cross it off of
                        my list. If I think about what I need/ want to do, it becomes a faint thought to me, and I later
                        forget to do it. Gael said it best, “If you simply think about a goal, you are using the right
                        side of your brain, your imagination. When you write down a goal you are using the left side of
                        your brain, the logical side”. Just take some time out of your day, about 2 hours of it, and
                        think of what you’re trying to accomplish this year. Will it be ridding dept? Saving up? Dream
                        Vacation? Whatever it may be, make sure you write it down. This is the Affirmation for your
                        life.

                    <p style="line-height: 3;">
                        Now Skydiving is VERY risky. Just the thought of skydiving can give you an adrenaline rush. I
                        personally have an infatuation with being free to the point of danger. I am personally not
                        recommending this if you are afraid of heights or if you are trying to overcome a fear of
                        skydiving simply because you have to be mentally prepared to jump as much as your body. This not
                        only gives you the rush that you might be craving, but something to look forward to in the
                        future. Go skydiving in Dubai if possible, the view is undefeated. But you have to follow
                        through with it. Maybe you can mentally prepare yourself by going indoor- sky diving first.

                    <p style="line-height: 3;">
                        Learning a New Skill can potentially be lifesaving. It can demolish that boredom you have been
                        aching to get rid of. With learning new skills, it doesn’t have to be something boring, but
                        something that piques your interest. You know, one of those “I’ve been thinking” ideas. Maybe,
                        you’ve always wanted to learn how to play poker, or learn how to ice skate. Or maybe you wanted
                        how to speak in public. You can make anything a skill, as long as you put your mind into it.
                        According to a study done at CCSU Business and Development, your brain chemistry changes, you’re
                        learning speed increases, you can make connections and etc.

                        This is normally everyone’s New Year’s Resolution. When you go to the gym during January, its
                        packed with people you’ve never seen before. Well, the key is consistency. You can go to the gym
                        once, and never think about it again. Now, make the bucket list say that you are trying to stay
                        consistent. Try going to the gym at least 3 times a week.

                    <p style="line-height: 3;">
                        If you are pro-gun, or pro protection, learning how to shoot a gun could be a learning
                        experience. Not only a learning experience, but a lifesaving experience. With the latest chaos
                        that seems to be extremely deadly, it’s better to be able to protect yourself in the moment and
                        carry gun knowledge. It may be a scary first time because I was scared when I shot my first gun,
                        but as you practice you gain confidence. Please make sure you are in a insured, certified gun
                        range that will be able to properly assist and teach you.

                    <p style="line-height: 3;">
                        Drifting is when you can drag a car in such angles that it burns tires. If you are a adrenaline
                        junky, this may be the hobby for you. You can go in circles with sharp turns as you pull the
                        emergency break and let the tires lock. This could become an interesting hobby depending on how
                        well you are. Make sure you do this with a trained professional that will be able to properly
                        assist you.

                    <p style="line-height: 3;">
                        Hang gliding is an air sport that requires you to not be afraid of heights. If you’re trying to
                        overcome the fear of heights, this may be the sport for you. This is a non-motorized, foot
                        launching off of a cliff, risky but free experience.

                    <p style="line-height: 3;">
                        If you believe that you can write a rap, harmonize on a beat, or do it for simple fun, this may
                        be a great way to start off the year. Call your local music studio and try to record a song with
                        a beat provided by them or if you’re courageous, make your own beat and bring it to the studio.

                    <p style="line-height: 3;">
                        Depending if you’re a profound personality or mentality, you can definitely write a deep poem
                        that may touch others. Write how you feel, go to your local open mic session and let your
                        emotions flow.

                    <p style="line-height: 3;">
                        Parasailing is a bit different from hang gliding, simply because you are in a parachute, flying
                        in the sky, over the ocean, off of a boat. Not the best explanation I know, but just search it
                        up, and give it a go!
