        The Power of Manifestation… What do you think of when you hear that?
        Well, the definition of Manifestation “an event, action, or object
        that clearly shows or embodies something, especially a theory or an
        abstract idea.” – Oxford Dictionary -
        https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/manifestation

        In other words, you have an idea, you think the idea through, and you
        execute the idea to the best extent. I have a personal experience that
        I had witnessed myself of someone using the power of manifestation to
        their best potential and ended up exactly where they wanted to be. A
        man by the name of JP Rand- https://www.instagram.com/jp_rand/ became
        the legendary; Lil Kim, one of the best female rapper’s hairstylist. I
        wanted to hear more about his story, so when I was in an internship
        with the radio station Hot 103.3 Jamz, I had the opportunity to bring
        him on for the podcast “People Places Things Podcast” with host Shay
        Moore. When he came, he brought up that he manifested the moments that
        he now has as a celebrity hairstylist. JP brought up multiple points
        on how he used to dream of doing Lil Kim’s hair. JP than began to work
        as hard as he could to get that dream to become a reality. He said
        “Growing up, I did not know much about her. My age group was Nicki
        Minaj, you know so when the comparison thing came about, and then I
        had like older siblings. So, they told me… I started to engage with
        her, she was hard.” He also said that he would start imagining himself
        doing Lil Kim’s hair. He mentioned that he would say “I am going to do
        Lil Kim’s hair” and before he knew it, he was on a plane headed to
        her.

        It’s all within your mental capacity and capabilities. It is also
        referred to as the Self-Fulfilling Prophecy. You are able to predict
        your outcomes, simply because you believe it. You have to start
        believing in yourself first. When you believe in yourself, you won’t
        need additional acceptance or approval from anyone else. You have to
        believe that you will be in that position and speak it into existence.
        I say all the time that I will be the next Oprah Winfrey but be myself
        while doing it. Obviously, I can’t become Oprah, but looking to her as
        inspiration and studying the different methods of success, I do
        believe that I can do it. I will do it. The next step is to treat
        yourself as if you are in that position already. Don’t wait to become
        happy once you are in that position, then that would mean you wouldn’t
        be happy at all to try. You need to start now. Appreciate the position
        you are in. Own it. But work harder also. You need to understand that
        working hard is the only way you can and will succeed, meaning
        multiple sacrifices. I don’t mean sell your soul and sacrifice your
        family members. I’m talking about the sacrifice that prevents you from
        doing what you want and doing what you need. You need to understand
        that it will contain hardship along the way, but it’ll all be worth
        it. Sometimes may be fun, while others can be difficult to pass. But
        it will all pass and all the hard work you put into it will work in
        your favor. Believe in yourself, and do not think about what others
        may think.
