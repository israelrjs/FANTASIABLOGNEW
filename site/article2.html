        Having a child is a heartwarming, loving, caring, and very new
        experience. To all of the new mothers out there, no. You are not
        alone. You aren’t the only one, and you do not have any issues.
        Firstly, I would like to congratulate you on the wonderful experience
        of giving birth. You’re alive, your baby is alive, and you are with
        your baby. Be proud.
      </p>
      <br />

      <br />
      <p>
        Secondly, just take a moment to re-evaluate yourself in the moment.
        You have a lot on your mind with a lot on your plate. Embrace it. Now,
        that we have a clearer head, we can continue. Why does it feel like
        your baby loves your mother, mother in law, or grandmother more than
        you? Firstly, no matter what you may think, your child loves you. You
        are the mother, the provider, the decider. You gave birth to a
        beautiful baby, so it is not your position you have to worry about.
        You do not need to worry at all, in all honesty. Are you a
        hard-working mother that had to go back to work months after giving
        birth? If you work a full-time job, 5 days a week your child is likely
        to get comfortable with who is providing and carping for them at the
        time being. Key word: time being. I am a mother that had to go back to
        work after giving birth to my daughter, and the split was terrible,
        but I knew it was necessary for stability. My daughter before I went
        back to work loved to be around me, hug me, love me, and smile at me.
        After I had to go backs to work and drop my daughter off at her
        grandmother’s house, it all changed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I found myself having to pick my daughter up without her wanting to be
        held by me. She would reach out her hands for her grandmother like I
        never existed. She would throw tiny temper tantrums when she was not
        held by her grandmother. That devastated me to the point of disbelief.
        Did I fail my child? Did I do something wrong?
      </p>

      <br />
      <h4>The Reality</h4>
      <p>
        The point that I did not want to understand was why? I already knew
        the reason. My daughter began to get comfortable, grow an attachment,
        and love the caregiver available to provide for her. I was gone 8
        hours out of the day, 5 days a week so its understandable.
      </p>
      <h4>The Understanding</h4>
      <p>
        Understanding the psychological aspect of your baby is very important.
        In the Developmental Psychology Theory, Erikson goes into depth with
        the reality of Stability Vs. Change. My daughter was always in
        Heterotypic stability. My daughter was always attached to me, at home
        with me, cuddling with me, sleeping with me, so she was used to me
        being there. I wouldn’t even say with me, because she didn’t know the
        difference between me as a mother, or me as a caregiver (yet). She was
        used to being near me constantly, but when things changed, she was
        able to catch on, but attach on to the other care giver as well.
        Gratefully, she wasn’t attached to the point of hysterically losing
        her mind every time she was off of my hip when I dropped her off.
        Since she was used to one person caring for her, she transitioned to
        accepting love and care from her grandmother. Babies love for people
        grows like anyone else, if someone is caring and loving them
        constantly, then the baby will definitely feel it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        No, I am not saying you aren’t taking care of your baby, or treating
        your baby right, or loving your baby, but consistency and reliability
        gives baby the re-assurance they are looking for.
      </p>
      <img src="A2p2.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="" />
      <h4>Theoretically Speaking</h4>
      <p>
        Yes, your mother, mother in law, or grandmother understands how to
        take care of a baby. They took care of babies, obviously. Babies can
        feel the difference between experience/ inexperience. Yes, you may
        have thought you had it down packed, but you can always learn more
        with parenting. There is never a “passing grade” with parenting,
        because you always come across something new throughout your parenting
        journey. Your mother, mother in-law, or grandmother may have just a
        tad bit more experience in raising children. Also, they may spend more
        time with your child. Meaning showing them attention, playing with
        them, carrying them, spoiling them and feeding them. I’m not saying
        you don’t, but if let’s be honest here at this moment. You may be able
        to spend just a tad bit more time spoiling your child yourself. I am
        guilty here, so there is no judgement at all, whatsoever. This does
        not mean that your baby does not love you, or hates you, or doesn’t
        want anything to do with you. Your baby simply does not have the brain
        capacity to do such. They can sometimes just favor the care provider
        at the time. It doesn’t mean it will stay the same forever. You may be
        working to pay off dept, or you plan on getting a promotion with
        better hours, or you may become your own boss with your own hours.
        They are just attached to the person that is currently caring and
        providing for them. Do not take it personal, because it is not bad.
        Stay strong and stay happy with your baby when you have the time. I am
        a mother working a full-time job and a full-time student. Whenever you
        do have free time, make sure you spend it with your baby. Regardless
        if you think you don’t have time, make time. And make the time count.
        Don’t think sitting with your baby while you’re on your phone is going
        to make an experience with your baby or think that your bond with grow
        closer by not interacting with your baby. I had to see what I was
        doing wrong, and I was not making sacrifices. I would spend time with
        my baby before work, and after work, and do homework when she was
        sleep for the night. I would stay up to study at night and do whatever
        else that I needed to do. I had to learn about time management and how
        to properly use my time wisely. I really hope that little article
        helped even a tad bit, especially for my younger mothers out here. We
        have to stay strong minded and work together and work hard while we’re
        doing it.
