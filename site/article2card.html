           <h2>1. Big Stepper- Roddy Ricch</h2>
        <img

          style="height: 70%; margin-left: 25%;"
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          Now, if you heard Roddy Ricch’s new album, then you will know that the
          ENTIRE album is a slap! His album Please Excuse Me for Being
          Antisocial is refreshing because you can tell he had fun in the studio
          while recording. You can feel the aura and atmosphere of his
          surroundings (here I go being fake deep). From the intro to the War
          Baby, I can say that the album will put you in the mood to get up and
          go! Where to? Wherever you want. This album is pure motivation,
          inspiration, a vibe, and definitely an album you can repeat. Some of
          the songs will be timeless; Start wit Me feat Gubba, High Fashion ft
          Mustard, and Big Stepper especially.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          Now this song in particular is very determining and enthusiastic. I
          loves how he says “I want a billion -----, so that’s on God I ain’t
          chilling” which gave me chills. This song makes you want to go mop
          your floor and finish the rest of your to- do list from last month.
          One thing I didn’t relate to was “My chef cooked up filet mignon, I
          sauced it and ate it”… Um, first off if the steak is good, you never
          sauce it! That’s rule 101, you take away from the natural flavors and
          texture when you put steak sauce on a steak. Well, that’s just my
          opinion. Carry on.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          Where does the title of the song come from? Well after doing some
          thorough research on “Big Stepper”, I seen on Urban Dictionary that
          the definition was an overachiever or someone who gets the job done.
          In his first verse he says “Big stepper like Big Meech, mhm”. I didn’t
          know who Big Meech was, so it was a slight history lesson. Big Meech
          is a MAJOR former drug dealer with the net worth over $100 million. He
          also was the head of ‘The Black Mafia Family’ (BMF) which was a drug
          trafficking and money laundering organization. I never knew. So, I
          believe Roddy Ricch sees him as inspiration to work hard, comparing
          himself with Big Meech on his work ethic.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          I believe everyone should give this album a go. There have been some
          comments regarding his similar sound to Young Thug. I wouldn’t say he
          sounds identical Young Thug simply because Roddy Ricch has a different
          melody and tone in his music, he hits great pronunciation skills are a
          killer “And I’m still heeeerrrreeee”. What do you guys think?

        <h2>2. Futsal Shuffle 2020- Lil Uzi Vert</h2>

        <img

          style="height: 70%; margin-left: 15%;"

        <br />
        <br />
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          I’m not going to lie; I love this song for multiple reasons.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            1) One, because as soon as the song play you hear Tyler The Creator
            “Yo sing that ---- are you ------- dumb?” and I said “Yeeeessssss
            this is a viiiiiibeeeee”. Then you here the deep bass, and if you
            have subs then you are luckily getting spoiled with this song!
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            2) Because he says, “Are you serious?” and the way he annunciates
            the question makes me understand where he’s coming from, as if I
            know.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            3) It’s so catchy! You can literally rock to this song anyway you
            want. Try rocking slow to it. Now rock faster, you are still on
            tempo right? Crazy!
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          This song is about his old girlfriend getting an imitation of him. He
          refers to the imitator as a “clone” and tells her to “do better”. Not
          only does he discuss his past boo, but he also raps about his soon to
          be boo and how he has to shoot a shot two times. Sending her two DM’s
          after she ignored the first, showing the ultimate thirst (it’s a
          joke). Overall, the song can get you hype, if you’re looking for a
          song with energy, give it a listen. It’s worth the listen. It gives
          you the ultimate confidence while listening to a bop. Canadian
          Musician and also interviewer was in the song towards the end with his
          famous “dododododo” along with the “thank you!!!”. It’s such a iconic
          moment in music history, definitely.

        <h2>3.	Puff Lah- Kaytranada</h2>

        <img
          src="2019musicimg/Picture3.png"
          style="height: 70%; margin-left: 15%;"
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
            Kaytranada, also a Canadian (DJ) is one of the most talented. I was today years old when I found that Kaytranada was Canadian, as he gives me California feels. He gives me so much Nostalgia and environmental comfort, it’s weird.  from “At All” by him in 2013-2014 to, I was hype to enter the world of Electronic music and experience the emotions that his music gives. It was reviving for me and truly an internal high listening. His latest album BUBBA is in the category of R&B/ Soul which this album definitely gives. 
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p>It’s a vibe.</p>

        <p style="line-height: 3;">
            Now, Puff Lah in particular is such a strolling down the street, in your drop top, on a sunny day, shades on, with the beautiful palm trees in the background type of song. It also makes me want to start rapping on it like I always try to do with his music. I don’t know, maybe he is trying to get a person to create a remix. All I know is that the song gives off positive energy. Whoever decides to create a remix, make sure you talk about how grateful you are, and the lessons you learned, and the life you want to manifest. Yes, this song speaks volumes with no words, and maybe it should be kept that way.
