      <p>
        Red Door is a great place to go with your friends and family to enjoy
        the great environment that the restaurant carries. The food is
        absolutely amazing, with a wide range of different options to choose
        from. When I went, the chicken alfredo (I’m not 100%) was delicious.
        The lively aura makes you feel important, with great vibes. I don’t
        remember much about the music, but the servers were on point with the
        service and is highly recommended.

        If you’re vegan, this is your spot! If you’re hungry, this is your
        spot! If you’re curious, this is your spot! I was introduced to this
        restaurant by a friend, and I was extremely unaware of how good vegan
        food actually was. The nachos are absolutely delicious, and the
        “cheese” actually tastes like dairy product. Weird right? It’s only
        nuts! If you’re downtown, at the plaza or Westport you should
        definitely stop by and try it out! You definitely won’t regret it!

      <h4>Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant</h4>

      <p>
        Now, Buca di Beppo may not be everyone’s favorite, but it sure is
        mine! If you are looking for more affordable (but not Olive Garden)
        Italian food, then this is your option! You can literally share every
        single plate that comes out with at least one additional person. The
        platters are humongous so you will not leave with an empty stomach but
        save room for deserts because they have plenty!

      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        This is one of the best sushi joints you can go and enjoy your
        favorite California rolls. This restaurant not only has the great
        customer service, but the music is absolutely wonderful. If you aren’t
        fond to eating with loud music, then I wouldn’t suggest this
        restaurant for you. The fresh sushi bar always stays busy with
        customers because the food proves the quality is worthy. Give this
        sushi bar a go, it will be a bang for your buck!

        Now you may be thinking what this is. This here my friend is one of
        the greatest soul food buffets in the history of soul food buffets.
        Not only is it affordable, but it is absolutely delicious. From the
        yams, to the fried chicken, everything is cooked to perfection. The
        seasoning in the food taste like it was made by my grandmother
        herself. The soulful touch to the restaurant is great for any family
        event, and if you’re lucky, it may be a date.

        Yes, sushi is my favorite food and it should be yours too! Have you
        experienced a tropical, mellow, but lively sushi bar in Kansas City?
        They have all of the nostalgic feels you are looking for in a
        California feel. One of the best features of this particular Sushi bar
        is their happy hour. Their happy hour isn’t stingy! Even on weekends,
        there is always a deal. If you’re planning on getting a drink with
        your meal, this is definitely the place to go.

        Lidia’s has a great classical feel. The food is elegant, and the
        aesthetic is rather pleasing. I enjoyed this restaurant. When I went,
        they had an unlimited serving or some pastas and other dishes. They
        had some of the best fried calamari that I have ever tasted. A
        wonderful experience that everyone should try out! Get a reservation
        with them for a special occasion, its fully worth it!
