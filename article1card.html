        <h2 style="text-align: center;">BUBBA- Kaytranada</h2>

        <br />
        <img src="k.png" style="height: 70%; margin-left: 25%;" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          This was a hard pick. I was contemplating on if it should be BUBBA or
          Please Excuse Me For Being Antisocial. The song was just the vibe I
          needed for this cold and chilly winter in Kansas. I have been able to
          thoroughly enjoy this album with no skips or no complaints. The song
          transitions are golden, blending in with the next song in que to play.
          I love the concept, and the feeling the album gives me. It’s not just
          music, it’s a mood too. Kaytranada has always given us positive
          up-tempo music, but the R&B route gives such a vibe. I’m not saying he
          hasn’t done R&B music before, but not as much as this current album.
          He has done great collabs with R&B artist that I loved so much, so it
          was greatly appreciated. I loved the EP Kaytranada released in 2018
          titled Nothin Like U, Chances. Also, Got it Good from his album 99.9%
          is lovely.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          The first song that I listened to by Kaytranada was At All, and I was
          hooked. I had to find out more about this man. Searching on Sound
          Cloud, iTunes, (at the time Apple Music was not available) Spotify,
          and YouTube. I tried to listen every song that he released. It was an
          experience of music that I never imagined to be so good.
        </p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Songs</h2>
        <br />
        <br />

        <h4>DO IT</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          It gives me Vice City Grand Theft Auto soundtrack vibes. Driving down
          the California streets like a normal civilian in your freshly stolen
          car (grand theft auto people, the game). The only bummer is how short
          the intro is, but it’s no complaints here. I guess less is more.
        </p>
        <h4>2 The Music</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          Iman Omari has defined R&B and soul to its entirety. This song has
          definitely been stuck in my head since the album came out. Iman
          Omari’s raspy but sly voice has this characteristic of being free and
          at liberty. The bass in the song (the actual instrument) added that
          flare in the song that made it perfect. The entire song is perfect,
          especially if you are looking forward to having a good time. This song
          probably gives others the best memories because it makes you
          appreciate your surroundings. You’re not as upset as you thought you
          were. Then the transition into the second portion of the song is just
          Godly. I kid you not.
        </p>
        <h4>Go DJ</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          I can see a rhythm skater dancing to this song, doing the most
          outrageous dance moves in my imagination. I can see this being a song
          Greek Organizations stroll to or a line dance.
        </p>
        <h4>Gray Area</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          This song is catchy; it makes you want to bounce. I knew the voice
          sounded familiar and come to find out it was Mick Jenkins. I don’t
          know the exact terminologies of the sound effects in the background,
          but it all harmonizes perfectly together. I love the pauses he takes
          in the song; it gives more emphasis.
        </p>
        <h4>Puff Lah</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE ALBUM. I just love this song so much, I want
          to rap on it, sing on it, dance on it, what ever on it. It’s just a
          perfect representation of chilling.
        </p>
        <h4>10%</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          You keep on takin from me, but where’s my 10%? Kali Uchis SNAPPED on
          this record. This is a slap. Do I understand the song? Not really, but
          it’s all good.
        </p>
        <h4>Need It</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          This makes me want to do Zaouli. The second-best song on this album.
          This is simply a bop. Again, the song is soooo short, I wish this one
          had some length to it.
        </p>
        <h4>Taste</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          VanJess came through with message! If you want a taste, bring
          something to the plate! She hit all the notes necessary in this song.
          She straight up to over this song. No remorse just snatched it and
          owned it.
        </p>
        <h4>Oh No</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">Extremely catchy. Estelle is a gem.</p>
        <h4>What You Need</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          This is such a great song for multiple reasons. 1. The song has great
          harmonizing. 2. I love the hook. 3. It makes me feel happy.
        </p>
        <h4>Vex Oh</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          “Should of said bye Felicia” that cracked me up. It gives me tropical
          vibez.
        </p>
        <h4>Scared to Death</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          This gives Electronic, Malibu hills. It gives me surfing with my
          friends on the shallow side, but we do it because it looks cool.
          Overall, it gives me inside of Urban Outfitters.
        </p>
        <h4>Freefall</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          The song starts immediately. Intentionally giving the careless,
          freefall, let go feeling. This is such a good song. I am thoroughly
          pleased with this song. The runs and notes are beautiful. It’s
          overwhelming, in the most beautiful way.
        </p>
        <h4>Culture</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          The rustic beat and the smooth voice just goes great together. I don’t
          want to sound redundant, but the song is florid, high-sounding,
          magniloquent and all of the above. It feels like I have honest stepped
          into Heaven while someone was performing. Like oh okay a heavenly
          concert? Bet.
        </p>
        <h4>The Worst In Me</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          Respect Tinashe. She is such a talented woman. The bells, her voice,
          the entire song just makes me feel… Positive. EVEN THOUGH IT’S A
          BREAKUP SONG.
        </p>
        <h4>September 21st</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          Gives me that dancing in your own world while everybody else watches
          but you don’t care. This gives me “I’m on another dimension right
          now”. This gives me cosmic relaxation. Just two galaxies just
          existing, having a good ole chat.
        </p>
        <h4>Midsection</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          Icons and legendddssssssssss! Pharrell was in this song and all I had
          to do was say OOOOOP. I love it, you don’t even have to play it.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p style="line-height: 3;">
          Kaytranada has contributed in my love for music. His music opened
          another chapter into my passion and love for music expressing my
          emotions. Not only does his music changes the entire aura, but it has
          a psychological effect to it as well. Kaytranada’s music gave me
          healthier stress levels, which was proven to help in a 2013 study.
          Literally, he’s saving my life (seriously, I’m not being dramatic.
          This is real). Music is a natural way of healing your mental
          capabilities, and I look at it as medicine. His music defines my
          personality; optimistic, rare, propitious and etc. Enough of hearing
          me carry on. Please give this album a listen.
