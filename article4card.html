                    <p style="line-height: 3;">
                        Moving out at the age of 18 can be taunting, or, if you’re in a bad situation; its seen as
                        relieving. I was one of those eager teens that were ready to move out as soon as I could. Things
                        just weren’t working out at home, and I felt the next necessary step for me was to move out as
                        soon as possible. Now, regardless of the situation, there are particular steps you need to take
                        before moving out of your parents, guardians’ home. Below I will explain the steps you should
                        take before moving out. Get your pin and paper ready, you will absorb a lot of information!
                    </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 3;">
                        Now, it may seem obvious that if you are 18 you are a legal adult, but this is mental. You may
                        need to have an epiphany before you realize that you will no longer be under your parents. You
                        have to train your mind to prepare for this large step. You are moving out of your parents’
                        home. The home you have been living in your entire life. The parents that you used to see every
                        day, you may or may not see them as often.

                        Not only will you not have the same procedures, but this transition can feel unbelievable. Well,
                        I am here to tell you that this is your life. You are no longer under your parents. The
                        decisions you make outside of your parent’s house will affect your future. Please think through
                        any large steps you may have, unless you are for certain of the steps you want to take.

                        Saving money is a key of importance! You will need money saved up for multiple purposes:

                        You may think if you have $500 saved up that would be enough money, but that is not enough money
                        for you to be safe and satisfied. As you see, the first to numeric points (Deposit, and first
                        months rent) you will need the amount around $500-$1,000. Obviously, you will need electricity,
                        gas, water, and other utilities that help with the daily functionalities. You will need
                        additional money for the activation fees or start up fees that may occur on the first bill.
                        Dave Ramsey has always said that you need an emergency fund starting off at $1,000. “The reason
                        to have an emergency fund is simple: You don’t know what’s going to happen. And no one wants to
                        live at the mercy of life’s twists and turns. Your emergency fund will come in handy if you
                        suddenly lose your job or your

                        net between you and life. Believe me . . .” – Rachel Cruze.
                        You may need the emergency fund to stop a medical bill from going to collections, or you may get
                        into a wreck and need to pay an deductible. You never know what can occur, and it’s always best
                        to be safe than sorry (and of course, broke).

                    <h2>Credit Score </h2>

                    <p style="line-height: 3;">
                        You will need some form of credit, or a co-signer of some sort to help with an
                        apartment/house/duplex. It’s always best if you do have your own credit score, but if you have
                        very helpful individuals around you like your parents, family, or friends, you may be able to
                        use them as a co-signer to get your first place. Keep in consideration that they do look at a
                        variety of different aspects for you to rent a home.

                        Get a secured credit card in your name (if you don’t have a credit card). Also, it may be a
                        wonderful idea to begin an authorized user account from a loved one’s account. Being an
                        authorized user will only affect the credit of the authorized user, not the account owners’
                        credit. So, they would be considered safe in regard to credit score. It’s a win-win for
                        everyone!
                        Starting off with some type of credit will give you a great boost to help apply for better
                        apartments in better locations. If you apply for apartments without a credit score or a low
                        credit score, you will most likely not get the application approved.

                        Be prepared to have a lot of self- discipline in your life! The fast-food life will become
                        measly. Not only fast-food restaurants, but restaurants in general. Choose grocery stores over
                        going out to eat. If you do decide to go out to eat, make it for special occasions only.
                        Food Drives may be a great source of food as well. There is never a such thing as being too good
                        to save money. You want to save as much money as possible. Food Drives give bags or boxes of
                        food away for free. Yes, that’s right! It’s absolutely free food and its edible. How can you
                        turn that down? Find a local food drive in your area, and stock up on food to put in your
                        kitchen, unless you your parents are paying to fill up your kitchen!
                        Pantries is another source of food that is basically free. Pantries are normally at local
                        churches, they may require additional information for their records such as a name, number,
                        address, and how much you may annually.

                        ALDI’s or other discount grocery stores. These discount groceries stores do come in handy when
                        you are trying to save o money, or money may be tight. It is no different than the food at
                        Walmart. It may not be “organic” or “cage free raised” but these are sources that can
                        potentially save you from burning holes in your pocket.

                        Pick an area near you that will effectively be convenient in your day to day commute. Somewhere
                        that is close to your job, your family, your school. Just something that is convenient and
                        comfortable.
                        If you can afford to, chose a nicer area with less trouble in the areas. Go for a tour on some
                        of the properties and take a lot of pamphlets that the renting managers may give you. Take about
                        2 weeks up to a couple months to find a great place for the time being.

                        Reliable Transportation is an important piece to being independent. It doesn’t matter if the
                        vehicle is a bucket, or if you have a motorcycle, or a bicycle. Having some form of
                        transportation can help you in so many ways. For instance, if you don’t have groceries, you
                        might not want to tote them around on a bag walking, taking a bus, or subway. Having reliable
                        transportation can make sure you get to school, work, or appointments on time.
                        If you do have a car already, you’re in luck! If you don’t, take a year to save for a cash car.
                        If you lease or finance a car, it may by costly and exceed your monthly salary commitment.

                        I know it may sound simple but keeping income will definitely help you out in the long run. It
                        doesn’t matter if it’s a part time job, serving, or doing uber. Just make sure that you have
                        constant income in your pockets before you decide to move out. Money may run short with your
                        family that could have said they would pay for you. You have to depend on yourself at all times,
                        and one way of doing that is to have your own financial support system!
                        With the few steps that were mentioned, I hope that you have a general idea of what you need to
                        do in order to move out of your parents’ house. These are very basic steps, and I will go in
                        more details with a different blog! Most importantly, please stay safe and be aware of
                        everything around you!
